package:pub_server
================

This package provides re-usable code for making a pub repository server. The
`package:pub_server/shelf_pubserver.dart` library provides a shelf HTTP handler
which provides the HTTP API used by the pub client. One can use different
backend implementations by implementing the `PackageRepository` interface of
the `package:pub_server/repository.dart` library.

Example pub repository server
-----------------------------------------

An *experimental* pub server based on a file system can be found in
`example/example.dart`. It uses a filesystem-based `PackageRepository` for
storing packages and has a read-only fallback to the real `pub.dartlang.org`
site, if a package is not available locally. This allows one to use all 
`pub.dartlang.org` packages and have additional ones, on top of the publicly
available packages, available only locally.

It can be run as follows
```
~ $ git clone https://github.com/dart-lang/pub_server.git
~ $ cd pub_server
~/pub_server $ pub get
...
~/pub_server $ dart example/example.dart -d /tmp/package-db
Listening on http://localhost:8080

To make the pub client use this repository configure your shell via:

    $ export PUB_HOSTED_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Using it for uploading new packages to the locally running server or downloading
packages locally available or via a fallback to `pub.dartlang.org` is as easy
as:

```
~/foobar $ export PUB_HOSTED_URL=http://localhost:8080
~/foobar $ pub get
...
~/foobar $ pub publish
Publishing x 0.1.0 to http://localhost:8080:
|-- ...
'-- pubspec.yaml

Looks great! Are you ready to upload your package (y/n)? y
Uploading...
Successfully uploaded package.
```

The fact that the `pub publish` command requires you to grant it oauth2 access -
which requires a gmail account - is due to the fact that the `pub publish`
cannot work without authenticatinon or with another authentication scheme.
*But the information sent by the pub client is not used for this local server
at the moment*.


NOTE: This is package is an alpha version and is not recommended for production
use.
